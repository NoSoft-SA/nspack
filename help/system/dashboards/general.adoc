== Dashboard configuration

Here you can create and modify dashboards - specifying the pages to cycle through and how long to spend on each one.

=== Types of dashboard

There are four types of dashboard pages:

internal:: These are dashboard pages defined in the system (e.g. a page of active production runs)
external:: These are pages  that are not defined in the system (e.g. an external BI summary page)
image:: These pages display an uploaded image or pdf
text:: These pages display a text message

=== How to work with this grid

* Each group of pages is a dashboard.
* A dashboard has a **key** and a **description**, and pages are grouped within a dashboard.
* Choose the _dashboard link_ option to get the link to paste into your browser to view the dashboard.
* You can click on _preview this page_ to preview just the selected dashboard.
* USe the add/edit/delete options as needed to add dashboards and pages.
* The number of seconds is the time that each page will display before moving on to the next page in the list for the dashboard.
