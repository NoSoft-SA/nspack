== Coding principle

These are the principles to be followed in writing code that uses the Crossbeams framework.
All applications should use Rubocop to enforce style and grammar rules.

=== Use styling standards

Make it easy for any developer to read and maintain any other developerâ€™s code.

=== Write code in layers

Separate routing, business logic, persistence and UI building.

=== Write short, focused methods

Methods should ideally do one thing in few lines of code.
They should be written to be maintainable.

=== Clear code rather than clever code

Always write code with an eye to you or someone else being able to understand and maintain it.

=== Isolate database access

Place all database manipulation code in repositories.
Business logic must use a repository to get data to or from the database.

=== Use value objects

Output from repositories should only contain simple value objects (entities) or basic data types (Integer, String, Array, Hash).
Avoid using rich model-like objects.

=== Communicate via response objects

Return standard response objects from methods that can be interrogated for success, messages and instance data.

=== Use the job queue for asynchronous work

If a bit of work involves long-running activity and the output of the task does not need to be returned to the user immediately, write a job to do the work.

=== Use services for complex business processes

A task that involves several steps and/or many resources should be done in a service.

=== Make the route code as simple as possible

Code in the routing layer should be restricted to:

* Check authorization
* Call the view layer
* Call the interactor layer
* Return response
