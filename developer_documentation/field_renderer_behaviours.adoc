== Behaviours

Behaviours are used to bring dynamic changes to forms in the UI.
e.g. To limit the options of one dropdown based on the current selection of another.

The following behaviours can be specified for a field renderer:

* <<Dropdown Change>>
* <<Enable>>
* <<Populate From Selected>>

=== Add a behaviour

In a UiRule, behaviours are added like this:
[source,ruby]
----
behaviours do |behaviour|
  behaviour.enable :other, when: :applet, changes_to: ['other']
end
----

=== Dropdown Change

Description:

This behaviour attaches to a select field and triggers a call to a url when the selected value changes.

Format:

`dropdown_change(field_to_observe, conditions = {})`

`field_to_observe` is the name of the dropdown field to observe for changes.

Conditions:

* `notify:` Array of Hashes
+
Notify Hash elements:
* `url:` String - the url to call when the selected value changes.
* `param_keys` [OPTIONAL] Array of Symbols - If matching an id in the form, the key+value will be sent as a parameter to the `url`. You can also define non-form keys which will use the matching value in `param_values`.
* `param_values` [OPTIONAL] Hash - a key must match a Symbol in `param_keys`. The value in the Hash will be sent with the key as a parameter to the `url`.
+

Example:

[source,ruby]
----
behaviours do |behaviour|
  # The typical case - one url notified of a change:
  behaviour.dropdown_change :program_id, notify: [{ url: '/a/path/to/somewhere' }]

  # Another possible case - two urls called and the second returns two extra parameters
  # - one from the form and one defined in the UiRules file.
  behaviour.dropdown_change :function_id, notify: [{ url: '/a/path/to/somewhere' },
                                                   { url: '/a/path/to/somewhere/else',
                                                     param_keys: %i[this_id users_user_login],
                                                     param_values: { this_id: 123 }
                                                   }]
end
----

Each declared `url` will receive a param named `changed_value` which contains the newly selected value from the select.
If the behaviour had any `param_keys` set, these will also be included in the params. Note that the `changed_value` can be empty
if the user cleared the selection.

Here is a simple example of a url route that updates a select's options when another select's selected item changes:
_(Note that the if statement would normally be in an interactor - this example is just for illustration purposes.)_

[source,ruby]
----
r.on 'select_change_for_pf' do
  if params[:changed_value].empty?
    sel = []
  else
    repo = SecurityApp::MenuRepo.new
    sel = repo.for_select_program_functions(where: { program_id: params[:changed_value] })
  end
  json_replace_select_options('functional_area_program_function_id', sel)
end
----

=== Enable

Description:

This behaviour attaches to a source field and enables/disables a target field(s) based on the value of the source field.

Format:

`enable(target_fields, conditions = {})`

`target_fields` is the name of the field (or an Array of field names) to be enabled/disabled.

Conditions:

* `when:` Symbol
+
The source field to observe.
* `changes_to:` Array
+

Example:

[source,ruby]
----
behaviours do |behaviour|
  behaviour.enable %i[more_info reason], when: :referred_by, changes_to: ['unknown', 'other']
end
----

=== Populate From Selected

Description:

This behaviour attaches to a select element (typically a multi) and adds selected items to a sortable element.
This allows a user to select items in one place and sequence them in another place.

Format:

`populate_from_selected(field_name, conditions = {})`

`field_name` is the name of the select field to observe.

Conditions:

* `populate_from_selected:` Symbol
+
An Array of Hashes. Each hash contains:
* `sortable:` Symbol
+
The DOM `id` of the sortable element in the page.

Example:

[source,ruby]
----
behaviours do |behaviour|
  behaviour.populate_from_selected :variant_product_code_column_ids,
                                   populate_from_selected: [
                                     { sortable: 'variantcolumncodes-sortable-items' }
                                   ]
end
----
