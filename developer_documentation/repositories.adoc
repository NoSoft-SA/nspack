== Repositories

The repository layer handles all database access and modification.

=== Helper methods for lookup arrays

These methods can be placed in any repository to provide methods to select arrays of values from the specified table.

==== for_select_table_name

This method returns a list of records from the table. It is built like this:

`build_for_select(table_name, options = {})`

required options

* `:value` - the name of the column in the table that provides the lookup value.

optional options

* `:label` - the name of the column in the table that provides the display value. Defaults to the value parameter. If this is an array of symbols, the label will show the columns separated by ` - `.
* `:alias` - An alias for the suffix of the for_select call. Defaults to the table_name.
* `:order_by` - A column name to use in the ORDER BY clause.
* `:desc` - If true and there is an `:order_by` setting, return in descending sequence.
* `:no_active_check` - Return all rows (including where active is false). This is required for tables that do not have and `active` column.

Example:

```ruby
build_for_select :commodities,
                 label: :code,
                 value: :id,
                 order_by: :code
```
Which is called like this: `repo.for_select_commodities`.

The results can be restricted by providing a where clause:

`repo.for_select_commodities where: { commodity_group_id: 123 }`

==== for_select_inactive_table_name

This method returns a list of records from the table that have their active column set to false.
This is mostly used as the value of `disabled_options` in a UI Rule for a `Crossbeams::Layout::Select`.
It is built like this:

`build_inactive_select(table_name, options = {})`

required options

* `:value` - the name of the column in the table that provides the lookup value.

optional options

* `:label` - the name of the column in the table that provides the display value. Defaults to the value parameter. Defaults to the value parameter. If this is an array of symbols, the label will show the columns separated by ` - `.
* `:alias` - An alias for the suffix of the for_select call. Defaults to the table_name.

```ruby
build_inactive_select :commodities,
                      label: :code,
                      value: :id,
                      order_by: :code
```
and called like this: `repo.for_select_inactive_commodities`. You cannot provide a WHERE clause.

=== Helper methods for simple CRUD

Use the `crud_calls_for` method to generate CRUD methods on a repository.

This generates appropriate `find`, `create`, `update` and `delete` methods for the given table.

`crud_calls_for(table_name, options = {})`

options

* `:name` - use this as the name suffix instead of table_name. i.e. `find_name` instead of `find_table_name`.
* `:wrapper` - The wrapper class to return from the `find`. If not provided, a `find` method is not generated.
* `:exclude` - An optional Array containing one or more of `:create`, `:update`, `:delete`. These methods will not be generated.
* `:schema` - An optional schema name as a Symbol. If it is not provided, `:public` is assumed.

Examples:

```ruby
crud_calls_for :users

# Generates the following methods for the repo:
create_users(attrs)
update_users(id, attrs)
delete_users(id)
```

```ruby
crud_calls_for :users, name: 'people', wrapper: User

# Generates the following methods for the repo:
find_people(id)
create_people(attrs)
update_people(id, attrs)
delete_people(id)
```

```ruby
crud_calls_for :users, name: 'user', wrapper: User,
               exclude: %i[delete update],
               schema: :audit

# Generates the following methods for the repo:
find_user(id)
create_user(attrs)
# Queries will run against the "audit"."users" table.
```

=== Built-in methods

These methods are available to all repositories that inherit from `BaseRepo`.
For straightforward usage, use the generated CRUD calls, but the builtin methods can also be used within developer-generated repository methods.

See link:/yarddocthis/lib=base_repo.rb[BaseRepo methods] for a list of methods in `BaseRepo`.
