== Routes

Routes should follow a `REST`-ish approach for CRUD actions.

For cases where a form is displayed and then applied, use the same URL for both GET and POST/PATCH calls

=== RESTful routes

|===
|Method |URL |Action

|GET
|`/animals/cats`
|List - display grid (actually done via /lists URL)

|GET
|`/animals/cats/new`
|NEW : display form

|POST
|`/animals/cats`
|CREATE : process form

|GET
|`/animals/cats/123/edit`
|EDIT : display form for cat with id 123

|PATCH
|`/animals/cats/123`
|UPDATE : process form data and apply to cat 123

|GET
|`/animals/cats/123`
|VIEW : Show data for cat 123

|DELETE
|`/animals/cats/123`
|DELETE : Delete cat 123

|===

=== Other routes

|===
|Method |URL |Action

|GET
|`/animals/cats/123/feed`
|Display a form to capture feed data for cat 123

|POST
|`/animals/cats/123/feed`
|Process data from form and apply to cat 123

|===

=== Roda routing tree

This example applies all the routes from the tables above.
