== How to use repositories

* Repositories are the layer between application code and the database.
* Repositories handle all the database reads and writes.
* Application code should not perform any database calls directly - only through a repository method - and all SQL should be defined in repository methods.
* The only exception to this is in the SQL in dataminer yml query definition files.
* A repository method should return only `Hash`, `Dry::Struct`, `OpenStruct`, `Array` or a primitive type like `Integer`. These can be wrapped in a `Crossbeams::Response` object.
