== How to implement a back button

When a page is displayed (not  in a dialog) you would usually want to provide a back button for the user.
Clicking this button should take the user to the page they were on regardless of what it was (could be an edit page or a grid page, even a page that is not part of the same applet).

To make this work without knowing which url to use in the link, do the following:

In the route, pass the result of the `back_button_url` helper as an argument named `back_url`:
[source, ruby]
----
r.get do
  # ..
  show_partial_or_page(r) { App::Prog::Det::Show.call(id, back_url: back_button_url) }
end
----

In the view use the `back_url` value for the button's url:
[source, ruby]
----
def self.call(id, back_url:)
  # ..
  section.add_control(control_type: :link,
                      text: 'Back',
                      url: back_url,
                      style: :back_button)
----
