== Test helpers

Helpers available during testing.

Include the helpers in your test file with this line:
[source,ruby]
----
require File.join(File.expand_path('../../../../test', __dir__), 'test_helper')
----

=== Current user

Call `current user` in your test to get an instance of a `DevelopmentApp::User` entity.

=== CRUD calls

This helper for Repositories will check that the expected crud calls methods are in place. Your test file must implement a method named `repo` which returns an instance of the repository under test.

Example:
[source,ruby]
----
module MasterfilesApp
  class TestCommodityRepo < MiniTestWithHooks
    def test_crud_calls
      test_crud_calls_for :commodity_groups, name: :commodity_group, wrapper: CommodityGroup
      test_crud_calls_for :commodities, name: :commodity, wrapper: Commodity
    end

    private

    def repo
      CommodityRepo.new
    end
  end
end
