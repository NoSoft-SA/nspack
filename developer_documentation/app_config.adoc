== App configuration

The application environment is set in the `RACK_ENV` environment variable.

Environments can be:

* development (default)
* production
* test

Environment variable loading uses the dotenv gem (https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv).

Development environment variables are set in the `.env` file in the root dir.
Per-machine overrides can be specified in a `.env.local` file (which is not checked in to version control).
