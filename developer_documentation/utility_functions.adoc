== Utility functions

There are a few utility functions that are defined in the `UtilityFunctions` module that perform miscellaneous tasks.

=== Date functions

[source,ruby]
----
UtilityFunctions.weeks_ago(Date.today, 3)   # => Date - three weeks before Date.today.
UtilityFunctions.weeks_ago(Time.now, 3)     # => Time
UtilityFunctions.weeks_ago(DateTime.now, 3) # => DateTime
UtilityFunctions.weeks_since(Date.today, 3) # => Date - three weeks after Date.today.

UtilityFunctions.days_ago(Date.today, 3)    # => Date - three days before Date.today.
UtilityFunctions.days_since(Date.today, 3)  # => Date - three days after Date.today.
----

Calculate the pick ref for today for a packhouse:
[source,ruby]
----
UtilityFunctions.calculate_pick_ref(9)  # => '3291' (if today is Tuesday in ISO week 13)
----

=== Miscellaneous

Get an ip address from a string that could be an ip address or could contain an ip address as part of a URI.
[source,ruby]
----
UtilityFunctions.ip_from_uri('192.168.0.1')                # => '192.168.0.1'.
UtilityFunctions.ip_from_uri('http://192.168.0.1:8080/')   # => '192.168.0.1'.
----

Deep merge two nested hashes. For matching keys, the value on the right overrides the one on the left. Extra keys from the right are added to the result.
[source,ruby]
----
left  = { one: { two: { three: 3 }, four: 4 } }
right = { one: { two: { three: 5 }, seven: 7 } }

UtilityFunctions.merge_recursively(left, right)

#=> { one: { two: { three: 5 }, four: 4, seven: 7 } }
----

Change keys of a nested hash from strings to symbols.
[source,ruby]
----
example  = { "one" => { "two" => { "three" => 3 }, "four" => 4 } }

UtilityFunctions.symbolize_keys(example)

# => { one: { two: { three: 3 }, four: 4 } }
