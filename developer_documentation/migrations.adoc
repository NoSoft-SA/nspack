== Migrations

=== Notes

The framework uses the Sequel migrations syntax and methods: link:http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/migration_rdoc.html[Sequel migrations].

Migration sequences use the datetime format (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`), not the integer format. So a migration for creating a users table on 15 September 2011 in the afternoon would look something line this: `20110915154521_create_users`.

=== Create a migration file

Migration files live in the `db/migrations` dir.

You can create a migration file using either of the following Rake tasks:

* `bundle exec rake db:create_table_migration`
+
Use this to create a migration file with skeleton code for creating a table. You must specify the table name using the NAME variable:
e.g. `bundle exec rake db:create_table_migration NAME=users`.

* `bundle exec rake db:new_migration`
+
Use this to create an empty migration file. You must specify the filename using the NAME variable:
e.g. `bundle exec rake db:new_migration NAME=add_title_to_users`.

You would typically use the first for creating a new table and the second for altering a table or creating an index.

=== The golden rules of writing migrations

Down cancels up exactly:: Whatever is done in an `up` migration must be exactly undone in a `down` migration.

Running `db:migrate` followed by `db:rollback` must leave the database in exactly the same state as before.

Files must be named in the correct sequence:: If migration A (a trigger) depends on a column defined in migration B there will be a problem.

This can happen if developer A starts writing a migration for a trigger. Developer B needs to create a new table and writes migration B and pushes it.

Developer A pulls the code and runs the migration. Then developer A realises that the trigger needs to make use of the new table and updates the trigger via an SQL client and saves the working code to the migration.

When developer A pushes this code, user C cannot run migrations because migration A refers to something in migration B. In this case, user A should rename migration A so that it sorts after migration B.

After code is shared, do not update a checked-in migration:: Once a migration has been pushed it should be considered frozen.

Any changes should become part of a new migration.

Exception to above -- down migrations:: You can fix a down migration that has been shared if it is not performing correctly for some reason.

[TIP]
.Check your migrations
====
A good check to do before you push code that includes migrations is to clear and re-create your test database:
[source,sh]
----
RACK_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:migrate[0]
RACK_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:migrate
----

If either command above fails you will need to fix something to make your migrations work for everyone.
====

=== Run and rollback migrations

`bundle exec rake db:version` shows the latest version in the db.

`bundle exec rake db:migrate` will run all outstanding migrations.
`RACK_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:migrate` will run all outstanding migrations against the test database.

`bundle exec rake db:migrate[version]` will migrate down (rollback) or up to a particular version (depending on the current version in the db).

e.g. `bundle exec rake db:migrate[20170101201533]` will:

* undo all the migrations that come after `20170101201533` if the current migration is higher (e.g. `20170101201545`).
* run all the migrations up to and including `20170101201533` if the current migration is lower (e.g. `20161222201545`).

`bundle exec rake db:rollback` will rollback the last applied migration - whatever it is.

`bundle exec rake db:recent_migrations` lists the 10 most recent migrations in decending order. This is useful to find the version for rolling back migrations.

=== Special cases

==== Created at and Updated at

Automatic filling-in of `created_at` and `updated_at` columns with the current time by triggers when a row is inserted or updated.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'sequel_postgresql_triggers'
sequel.migration do
  up do
    extension :pg_triggers
    create_table(:table_name, ignore_index_errors: true) do
      primary_key :id
      # â€¦
      datetime :created_at, null: false
      datetime :updated_at, null: false
    end

    pgt_created_at(:table_name,
                   :created_at,
                   function_name: :table_name_set_created_at,
                   trigger_name: :set_created_at)

    pgt_updated_at(:table_name,
                   :updated_at,
                   function_name: :table_name_set_updated_at,
                   trigger_name: :set_updated_at)
  end

  down do
    drop_trigger(:table_name, :set_created_at)
    drop_function(:table_name_set_created_at)
    drop_trigger(:table_name, :set_updated_at)
    drop_function(:table_name_set_updated_at)
    drop_table :table_name
  end
end
----

==== Automatic logging of changes

The trigger creates copies of rows on insert and update.

See link:/developer_documentation/how_to_log_status_and_changes.adoc[how to log status and data changes].
[source,ruby]
----
up do
  run "SELECT audit.audit_table('table_name', true, true, '{updated_at}'::text[]);"
end

down do
  # Drop logging for this table.
  drop_trigger(:table_name, :audit_trigger_row)
  drop_trigger(:table_name, :audit_trigger_stm)
end
----

==== Automatic protection of special data

Block users from changing table data that application code requires.

See link:/developer_documentation/how_to_protect_masterfile_data.adoc[how to protect masterfile data].

[source,ruby]
----
up do
  unless ENV['RACK_ENV'] == 'test'
    run <<~SQL
      SELECT set_reserved_data_on_table('table_name', 'field_name', '{VALUE}'::text[]);
    SQL
  end
end

down do
  unless ENV['RACK_ENV'] == 'test'
    run <<~SQL
      DROP TRIGGER check_for_reserved_data ON table_name;
    SQL
  end
end
----

==== Extended columns

See link:/developer_documentation/how_to_use_extended_columns.adoc[how to use extended columns].

[source,ruby]
----
Sequel.migration do
  change do
    extension :pg_json
    add_column :table_name, :extended_columns, :jsonb
  end
end
----
